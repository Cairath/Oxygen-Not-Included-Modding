In this section you will learn how to download and configure development environment required for modding, compile your first mod, and see it in game.

The guide will focus on creating a mod that modifies the game logic, i.e. not just a world generation template. World generation will be covered in another section.

       <b>IMPORTANT: This guide has been written with the updates to modding on the testing branch in mind. Current live branch uses .NET Framework 3.5. This is a breaking, non-compatible change that you have to keep in mind before the testing branch goes live, should you want to start developing for the older version.</b>
