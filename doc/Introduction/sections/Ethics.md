## Modding Ethics
First and foremost, **don't be a jerk.** We're a small and tight knit community with most modders knowing one another.  

**Keep in mind that you are dealing with Intellectual Property that does not belong to you.**  
You have **absolutely no rights** to distribution of the game code, assets or any files that come from Klei.  Do not upload the decompiled sources to any repository, it is illegal. For more content creation guidelines, please [read these policies by Klei](https://www.klei.com/mod-player-creation-policy).

**Respect others and their work. Code being publicly available does not mean you are permitted to copy it and use as your own.**  
All modders work hard on their mods and nobody likes when their stuff is used without their permission. Many display their code publicly so that others can learn from it, but will get upset if you blatantly copy big chunks of their work. Always check the license in the repository or whether the author wrote something about permissions in the repository readme file - licenses like MIT allow free use of the code, but if there is no license in the repository it means you are not licensed to use it at all, unless given explicit permission from the author.

**When in doubt - ask, but put in effort first.**  
We reside in a [discord server](https://discord.gg/EBncbX2) (in the modding section) where we are happy to help you get started, but don't try to skip on reading the guide and rush to about things covered here. ~~There are no *dumb questions*~~ (okay, there are), but most of them can be solved through a simple search.
