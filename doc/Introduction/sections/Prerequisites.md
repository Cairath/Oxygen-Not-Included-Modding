## Prerequisites
* Windows OS - .NET Framework 3.5 used by the game is not supported on other operation systems. Workarounds exist but will not be covered in this guide and there are not many people modding on other systems to get help from.
* At least basic knowledge of C# (you *will* be required to read up on more advanced concepts, depending on the depth of your mod). **We will not teach you C#, that one is on you.**
* Understanding of [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) - the library we use for patching game methods. **Reading and understanding [Harmony documentation](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/patching.html) is absolutely mandatory before proceeding.**
