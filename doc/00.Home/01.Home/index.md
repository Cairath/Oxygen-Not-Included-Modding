## Preamble

In this guide, you will be given a quick tutorial on the basics of modding, and getting your mod up and running. As well, you can read on for in-depth explanations on the various aspects of mods of varying difficulties.

Have a look at the sidebar for a list of all things covered in these chapters.

## First Things First

### A DISCLAIMER

This guide ***will not*** be teaching you programming nor Harmony. You will be expected to know this ahead of time and this guide will be assuming you have at least a basic understanding of the the technologies involved. More detail is available in the [Introduction](Introduction) section.

### DISCLAIMER 2 (Electric Boogaloo)

Modding in Oxygen Not Included does not use any kind of an API exposed by the game. It is done by patching the game source code As such, expect the modding to be something that changes relatively often (especially in Spaced Out that is still in development!) and understand the possibility that updates, particularly big ones, can (and often do) break mods. The staff at Klei are people too.
