## Local Install
Mods can be installed locally should the mod not be available on Steam, you want a specific version, Steam is refusing to serve the correct version, or really any other reason. Simply copy the entire folder containing the `.dll` (**not** as a zip or other archive) into the `mods\Local` folder within the game's files, creating it if it does not exist. The mod's name in-game will be the name of the folder, verbatim.

Other than mentioned above, the mod will function identally to one installed via Steam. If you want your mod to behave different upon a crash, see the development section for more info on the `mods\Dev` folder.

### Sharing Local Mods
Nothing says you *have* to publish to Steam (and there are valid reasons not to), so you can simply place the folder containing your mod files into an archive (`.zip` or similar) and send it to whoever you which via whatever platform you desire. The person on the other end needs to simply unpack the archive and the game will load the mod.
